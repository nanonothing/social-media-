...but force states to recognize out-of-state marriages under right-to-travel. Way to split baby ("incremental change" etc.). #SSM #SCOTUS
E.g., if Kennedy not ready for full #SSM, or feels need to exhort states' rights, could reject EP/DP args for in-state marriage... #SCOTUS
Would love to see #SCOTUS rule on right to travel. Glad Tanco pet raises it. Of course, it does have potential downside. #SSM #SCOTUS
Of course, 6th Cir managed to skirt right-to-travel arg - but did so by misconstruing/misunderstanding it. #SSM #SCOTUS
But where judges reject EP & DP for not-yet-married, should be no way round right-to-travel arg for already-married. #SSM #SCOTUS
Right-to-travel arg gets lost because it overlaps w/ EP & DP - and because EP & DP needed for not-yet-married couples. #SSM #SCOTUS
Right-to-travel arg very strong (my fave) for already-married couples. But does nothing for not-yet-married couples. #SSM #SCOTUS
