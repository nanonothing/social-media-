Of course, 6th Cir managed to skirt right-to-travel arg - but did so by misconstruing/misunderstanding it. #SSM #SCOTUS
But where judges reject EP & DP for not-yet-married, should be no way round right-to-travel arg for already-married. #SSM #SCOTUS
Right-to-travel arg gets lost because it overlaps w/ EP & DP - and because EP & DP needed for not-yet-married couples. #SSM #SCOTUS
